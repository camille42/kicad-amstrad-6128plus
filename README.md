# kicad-amstrad-6128plus

My first big project with Kicad.

As i'm not an expert, don't expect everything to be perfect in the first release.

For the first release, i focussed on :
    ** Memory
    ** RGB signal

* For Schematics :
    There is differences between the hardware & schematics & documentation
    ** Some values for resistors are different
    ** the R182 is replaced by a bridge & not present in the documentation
    ** ...

* For PCB :
    I can't find proper elements like keyboard connector, RJ6, centronic, so as it takes
    time to produce, it is not yet correct.
